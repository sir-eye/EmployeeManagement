Employee Management Project

Welcome to the Employee Management Project repository! This lab was completed as part of the Full Stack Java Programming Bootcamp under the guidance of Ms. Lewis.


Objective:
This lab is designed to provide hands-on experience with essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, focusing on:
1. Encapsulation through private fields and public methods.
2. Constructor usage for object initialization.
3. Method overriding (toString, equals, and hashCode) to enhance object behavior.
4. Calculation methods to implement real-world functionality.


Lab Objectives and Features:
Employee Class:
1. Fields:
     - Private fields to represent the properties of an employee:
     - firstName (String)
     - lastName (String)
     - title (String)
     - payRate (double)
     - These fields ensure data encapsulation.
2. Parameterized Constructor:
     - Ensures all fields are initialized when creating an Employee object.
3. Methods:
    - calculateWeeklySalary:
     - Computes weekly salary based on a standard 40-hour workweek.
    - Overloaded calculateWeeklySalary:
     - Allows calculation of salary for custom hours worked.
    - Getters and Setters:
     - Provide controlled access to private fields.
    - toString Method:
     - Provides a readable representation of an Employee object.
    - Example: Employee [firstName=John, lastName=Doe, title=Software Engineer, payRate=50.0]
    - equals Method:
     - Compares two Employee objects based on firstName, lastName, and title.
    - hashCode Method:
     - Generates a hash code based on the fields used in equals.

Main Class:
1. Demonstrates object creation using the parameterized constructor.
2. Calculates and displays weekly salaries using calculateWeeklySalary methods.
3. Prints string representations using the toString method.
4. Compares Employee objects using the equals method.
